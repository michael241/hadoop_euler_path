# hadoop_euler_path
Using MrJob, this code finds if a graph has an Euler path or not.<br />
<br />
Files: <br />
g1.txt, g2.txt, g3.txt, g4.txt: each of these describe a graph in terms of its vertices and edges.  A vertices is denoted with a number.  An edge is denoted on each line as the connection between the two listed verities. <br />
konigsberg.txt: same notation as above; this file describes the graph of of Euler's Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem.  <br />
euler_path.py: this file reads a graph and outputs if it has an Euler path or not. <br />
